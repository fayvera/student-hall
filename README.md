Welcome to the Study Hall!

In order to get started, you will need the following gems:

gem 'sinatra'
gem 'activerecord', '~> 6.0.0', :require => 'active_record'
gem 'sinatra-activerecord', :require => 'sinatra/activerecord'
gem 'rake'
gem 'require_all'
gem 'sqlite3'
gem 'thin'
gem 'shotgun'
gem 'pry'
gem 'bcrypt'
gem "tux"
gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.0'
gem 'sinatra-flash'


Once they are required in your Gemfile, run bundle install. 
Install the necessary gems depending on your personal machine.


To run the application, you will need to run "shotgun" in your terminal. This will start the server.
On your browser, open the URL 'localhost9393' and you should see the application so long as the server is still running.

This App is a place where students can go to share resources and enroll in different courses. 
They can create different courses along with that so that they can study different subjects as they please!
